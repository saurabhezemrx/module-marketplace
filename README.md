## Extending Marketplace

### Register your update channel

Custom update channels are registered via separate module with `di.xml` file
instructions. See following examples:

 - [Swissup, Firecheckout, Argento](https://github.com/swissup/module-marketplace/blob/master/etc/di.xml#L111-L151)
 - [Private channel as separate module](https://github.com/swissup/module-marketplace-channel-github)

### Create one-click installer

One-click installer is registered with `etc/marketplace/installer.xml` file.
See following examples:

 - [Absolute Theme](https://github.com/swissup/theme-frontend-absolute/blob/master/etc/marketplace/installer.xml)

## FAQ

### Can I install modules from the packagist?

Yes. But via CLI only.

### Can I install modules from private repository?

Yes. But via CLI only. Here is an example:

```bash
# 1. Add your private repository to the composer.json
composer config repositories.<id> vcs https://github.com/repo/url.git

# 2. Setup auth data. Get token at https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=repo
bin/magento marketplace:auth github-oauth.github.com <token>

# 3. Use marketplace to download the module and run installer (if any)
bin/magento marketplace:package:require <package/name>
bin/magento marketplace:package:install <package/name>
```
